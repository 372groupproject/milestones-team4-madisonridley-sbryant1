To make an Icon executable, one first has to download and install the Icon programming
language to the device of your choice from https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95w.htm

Once installed write code in the text editor of your choice and save as an .icn file.
In order to compile the code that was just created, open command prompt or powershell,
and insure that you're in the same directory as your code.

To compile your code -> icont example.icn

Once compiled, run your code -> .\example
