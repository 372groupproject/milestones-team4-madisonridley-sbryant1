The purpose of the icon project is to read a text file generated by numbers_generator.java and
sort the numbers via quick sort and merge sort and to display how long it took for quick sort and
merge sort to sort all of the random numbers. The idea was to take the same numbers txt file and to use it
for sorting in python and java and compare it to icon to see how long it took each language to sort. The 
final results are in the Sorting Results excel file.

As stated in project video, you can modify the icon program to actually print out the 100000 unsorted and
sorted numbers for verification. You'll also need to manuall edit the get_numbers() procedure to specify 
which txt file you want to read.

The comments in numbers_generator.java specify what to do, make sure that when you run the Final_Project 
program, that the numbers txt file is located in the same directory.

Check the README in the code folder for how to compile and run icon programs, if necessary.
